Twitter FollowBot 

The program is a menu drive program that allows you to identify twitter follow-bots by examining:
o	Whether the account has a profile picture
o	How many followers and friends the account has
o	How many tweets the account has
o	The relative creation date of the account
o	Whether the account has a bio
o	If the account's screen name has the word 'bot' or numbers in it
If I had more time, I would improve the exception handling of the program, the logical flow of the program, and the presentation of the report for the follow-bots.

How to Run

Download python
Before running the application, create an twitter account. 
Then apply for a developer account at ```https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access```
Then create an app with consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret. Replace your the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret in the code with the ones provide in your app.
If you do not do the steps above, the programme will not work.
Run code ```python3 osineye_finalp.py```
Also replace the twitter account to access for twitter bots by replavce the variable ```twitterAccount``` with the handle of the twitter account you want to examine.
